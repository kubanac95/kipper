## ðŸ“‹ Project

The idea behind the project is to see what it takes to create a service like Dropbox or Google Drive using the [Cloud Storage | Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) and other firebase libraries to accomplish it.

In the end I would like to have a template project for anyone to re-use and utilize [Firebase Spark Plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) to store some of their data behind a secure app.

It will be fun and challenging and most importantly my firs open source project. Wish me luck!
